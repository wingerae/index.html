        <p>
             For my independent project, I am going to rework the user experience design project that I created in SMAD 203. The original UX project was to create an app helping Harrisonburg residents with dining options. The assignment involved a project overview, user research, and user narratives.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Now that I am further along in the SMAD program, I feel much more qualified to conduct user experience design. My independent project name is UX Design: Dining in Downtown Harrisonburg. I am going to demonstrate my personal expertise in the categories of UX Research, and UX Design & Prototyping. The main audience will be JMU students and Harrisonburg residents. The app could also be very useful to people visiting the area because they may not know the best places to dine.
        </p>

            I am going to elevate my SMAD 203 project to show off the skills that I have gained throughout the past year. My plan is to break up the project into four deliverables and to give myself one week for each. The first deliverable will be to conduct competition analysis and make a list of design requirements. The second deliverable will be brainstorming ideas and sketching. The third deliverable will be to create my prototype(s). If I have time I will make a high-fidelity prototype, but I will most likely only have time for a low-fidelity prototype. Finally, my last deliverable will be to create a written report showcasing my project and all of the steps I took to reach my end goal.
